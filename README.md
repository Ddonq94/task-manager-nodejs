# Getting Started with Task manager Nodejs REST API

This is just a simple nodejs RESTful api for managing tasks

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

then

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3500](http://localhost:3500) to view it in the browser.

You will need an env file to keep **MONGO_URL** and **PORT**

Endpoints follow standard REST structure for CRUD operations and can be found on the base route: `/api/v1/tasks/`

Enjoy.
